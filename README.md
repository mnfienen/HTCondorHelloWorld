# HTCondorHelloWorld
Hello world trivial toy example for working with HTCondor on Linux

This uses a simple Python script to demonstrate a general HTCondor submit file. Of course, the intent is that the trivial example be replaced with meaningful work!

In the folder `demo` is an jupyter notebook (Demo\_Notes.ipynb) describing (sketchily) the other files and walks through the demo. There is also an HTML version of the notes for people not using jupyter notebook.

This demo was developed for the 2015 Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium meeting in Boulder, CO August 13, 2015 by Mike Fienen (USGS). Accompanying slide deck in Presentation.pdf created by Randy Hunt (USGS) and Willem Schreuder (Principia Mathematica).
